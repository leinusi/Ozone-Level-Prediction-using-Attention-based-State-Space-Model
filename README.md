# Ozone Level Prediction using Attention-based State Space Model

This repository contains the implementation of an attention-based state space model for predicting ozone levels in cities. The model combines attention mechanisms and state space modeling techniques to capture long-term dependencies and dynamic variations in time series data.

# Model Architecture

The model consists of three main components:

 Attention Module: The attention module is designed to capture long-range dependencies in the time series data. It takes the input data and computes attention weights to focus on relevant information across different time steps.

 State Space Model (SSM): The state space model is used to model the dynamic changes in the time series. It consists of an observation model and a transition model. The observation model maps the input data to the hidden states, while the transition model captures the temporal evolution of the hidden states.

 Ozone Model: The ozone model combines multiple SSM modules in parallel to enhance the expressiveness of the model. The outputs from the attention module are fed into each SSM module, and the final prediction is obtained by averaging the outputs from all SSM modules.

# Dataset

The model is trained and evaluated on the ozone level dataset (target.npy). The dataset contains ozone concentration measurements for multiple cities over a certain period of time. The data is preprocessed and reshaped into the format of (num_days, num_cities, 1) before being used for training and testing.

# Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss function. The dataset is split into training and testing sets based on a specified ratio. The training process involves iterating over the training data in batches and updating the model parameters using backpropagation.

During testing, the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
R^2 Score
# Results

The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data, and the predicted ozone levels are compared with the true values. A visualization of the predicted and true ozone levels is generated to provide a visual comparison.

# Dependencies

The code requires the following dependencies:

PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
Usage

To run the code, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. Place the ozone level dataset (target.npy) in the same directory as the code file. Run the code using a Python interpreter, and the model will be trained, evaluated, and the results will be displayed.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different hyperparameters or adapt it to your specific use case.
